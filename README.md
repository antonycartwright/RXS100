# Yamaha RXS100 Electrics!

There are very limited resources available regarding this model, so I thought I'd do some experiments and research and publish my findings for all to use. I will document the following goals:

My first goal is to publish a new and complete, checked wiring diagram of the RXS100. 
My second goal is to explain exactly how the wiring works.
My third goal is to propose a solution to a 10.8-12.6v lithium conversion.
My fourth goal is to convert it!

As I work on the project, I aim to release schematics and videos. The schematics can be viewing in this repo, but the videos will be shown below:
