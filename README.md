# Yamaha RXS100 Electrics!

This repo is about understanding the electrics of the Yamaha RXS100. There are very limited resources available regarding this model, so I thought I'd do some experiments and research and publish my findings for all to use.


As I work on the project, I aim to release schematics and videos. The schematics can be viewing in this repo, but the videos will be shown below:
